# FirebaseSample

## Why did I choose this Subject?

I decided to attempt Google Firebase because of it's user friendly GUI. It can host small or large sites, works as a database and offers authenticaton, it's pretty much a one-stop-shop!

## What problem Does it solve?

I think that I covered that in the last question, but essentially for a more visual way to work with a database. It beats using Express, and mongo once you get the hang of it.

## What are the hurdles?

Like with anything learning something new can be hard but with enough searching or youtube-surfing it can be done.
Just remember that you must require a module before you can use it!

## Good Recources?

I think the Google Firebase Documentation is great! They even have videos through-out it as if their GUI wasn't visual enough!
I think that google understands that a lot of people learn by watching!
